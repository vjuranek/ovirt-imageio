# Development

## Getting the source

Clone from gerrit:

    git clone git://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-imageio

Apply the git commit template:

    git config commit.template commit-template.txt

Install the commit message hook:

    wget -P .git/hooks https://gerrit.ovirt.org/tools/hooks/commit-msg

Edit the commit-msg hook to add Signed-off-by header. Add this at the
end of the commit-msg hook:

    # Add Signed-off-by trailer.
    sob=$(git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT | sed -n 's/^\(.*>\).*$/Signed-off-by: \1/p')
    git interpret-trailers --in-place --trailer "$sob" "$1"

Make the commit-msg hook executable:

    chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg


## Setting up development environment

Install the runtime requirements using automation packages files:

For Fedora 30:

    sudo yum install $(cat automation/check-patch.packages.fc30)

For CentOS 7:

    sudo yum install $(cat automation/check-patch.packages.el7)

For CentOS 8:

    sudo yum install $(cat automation/check-patch.packages.el8)

Install development tools:

    yum install git-review

Upgrade pip, since older pip versions have issues with installing
correct version of requirements:

    sudo pip install --upgrade pip

Install development python packages:

    pip install --upgrade --user -r docker/requirements.txt

Except when upgrading pip itself, do not use pip as root unless you like
a lot of pain.

Do not install pytest in your development machine. pytest will be
installed by tox in a virtual environment. If you need pytest for other
projects install it in a virtual environment for the other project.


## Running the tests

Create storage for the tests:

    make storage

See "Creating storage for tests" for more info.

Before running the tests, make the project:

    make

To run all the tests:

    make check

When working on a specific component, best change to the component
directory and run only the component test:

    cd common
    tox

When working on a specific module, best run the specific module tests
directly using tox:

    tox -e py27 test/foo_test.py

You can also use -k to select only certain tests. Check all available
options using:

    tox -e py27 -- --help

## Using non-standard qemu version

Some tests run qemu-kvm. To your own qemu-kvm built from source, you can
specify the path to qemu in the QEMU environment variable:

    QEMU=../../qemu/build/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 tox -e py27

## Submitting patches

To send patches for master branch:

    git review

To send a backport to older branch:

    git review ovit-4.3

To checkout patch from gerrit (e.g. https://gerrit.ovirt.org/c/101904/):

    git review -d 101904


## CI

Running tests locally is convenient but before your changes can be
merged, we need to test them on all supported distributions and
architectures.

When you submit patches to gerrit, oVirt CI will run all the tests on:

- CentOS 7, x86_64
- Fedora 29, x86_64
- Fedora 29, ppc64

Note that tests using 4k storage cannot run in oVirt CI, but they can
run in Travis CI. This is not integrated yet with gerrit, but easy to
run manually.

On Travis CI all tests run on:

- CentOS 7, x86_64
- Fedora 29, x86_64

To test your changes on Travis:

- Fork the project on github
- Visit https://travis-ci.org, register using your github account, and
  enable builds for your ovirt-imageio fork
- Push your changes to your github fork to trigger a build


## Creating storage for tests

The tests use the userstorage tool to create files and block devices
with various sector sizes for testing.

To create storage run:

    make storage

The storage is configured in the file `storage.py` in the root of the
project. Tests that use user storage load this configuration file and
access the storage via the BACKENDS dict.

Some storage may not be available on all environments. For example on
CentOS 7 userstorage cannot create storage with 4k sector size, and in
oVirt CI, this usually fails. Tests should check if storage exists and
mark test as xfail or skip when the storage is not available.

Usually there is no need to delete storage created by "make storage",
however if you want to do this, run:

    make clean-storage

For more info on userstorage see https://github.com/nirs/userstorage.


## Installing the proxy with engine development environment

During development you may want to build/install the proxy.  There are
a few ways to go about this:

- `ovirt-imageio-proxy [options]` - run the proxy in-place, with debug
   options and alternate paths to configuration files, if desired.

- `python setup.py install` - Build/install the lib files and main
  script, but not the service/log/etc files.

- `make install` - Build/install everything (with DESTDIR specified
  if packaging); this uses python-setuptools for some of the work.

- `make rpm` - Build the proxy and setup rpms; this uses
  python-setuptools for some of the work.


## General tips

When using an editor with code completion, it may be useful to have run
`make generated-files` to create any files with constants that depend
on the environment.


## Organizing imports:

Imports should be organized in the following groups, separated by one
blank line:

- Future import group (e.g. `from __future__ import ...`)

- Standard library (e..g `import os`)

- "from" imports (e.g. `from contextlib import closing`)

- 3rd party imports (e.g. `import six`)

- Local imports (e.g `from . import ...`)

As a general rule, only modules should be imported, never import names
from modules. The only exception is common imports from the standard
library (e.g. contextlib.closing).
